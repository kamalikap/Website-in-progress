		<h2>MAY 19, UEFA CHANPIONS LEAGUE</h2>

		<p>AFTER watching yesterday's match I wondered if these two teams really deserved to play in the finals of UCL? I may not be knowing much about football but as a spectator I felt disgusting and sleepy watching this boring match, what were they doing the first 80 mins if they had to play for only 10 mins? </p>

		<p>I  am neither a <strong> Bayern Munich</strong> supporter nor a <strong>Chelsea </strong> suporter but I may tell you that BAYERN MUNICH did have bad luck, after getting around 20 corner kicks they could not get a goal where as CHEALSEA got one corner kick nd made full use of it, lucky guys! FEELING SORRY for Bayern Munich as they gave a nice fight but got defeated by destiny. Of course DROGBA and TORRES played well. If coach Roberto Di Matteo allowed torres to play from the first then it would hav been a more interesting game to watch.</p>

		<h2>FIRST EXTEMPORE</h2>

		<p>Today I had my English test and it was my first time speaking in front of the class, where each one of the five selected students were shown three pictures. From those pictures each student had to speak about a topic for one minute without unecessary pause.Among the three choices I chose to speak about the traffic disturbance caused by stray animals. I stood still in front of the whole class, shaking with nervousness and skipping heart beats. I couldn't speak more than 20 secs when my feet started shaking. Everyone was staring at me, I was consoling myself that I can do that but I failed. My English teacher asked me "Do u want to speak later on?", without giving it a second thought I replied her "yes ma'am". Thanks to ma'am that she allowed me to speak for the second time. I came back to my seat and thought of changing the topic. Time passed by very quickly and my turn came. This time I did not wanted to loose it so I spoke about a picture showing, a girl learning karate. Though I was shaking I started to speak with a smile on my face. This time I spoke more confidently as compared to the last time but not very well as I couldn't end it properly as there were no points left. After it ended I wished that again I could speak and let everyone know what I felt while speaking for the first time. But now I feel more confident and wish to polish my public speaking abilities, cause I know it's never too late to start.</p>

	
		<p>Today I could understand how difficult it is to speak in public, hats off to them who carry themselves on-stage so well. But one thing I learned, with practice one can become a good speaker in public and I hope, I shall get more opportunities like this so that I can overcome my fear of speaking in public.</p>

		<h2><b>&quot;Life is so complicated&quot;</b></h2>

		<p>I want to call you but you won&apos;t pick up
			<br> I want to invite you but you won&apos;t come
			<br> I want to explain it to you but you won&apos;t listen
			<br> I want to ask you but you wont answer
			<br> I want to state it bt you will ignore it
			<br> I love u, but you wont pay attention to it
			<br> It&apos;s all in my mind and I did expressed it.

		<h2>WORDS WHICH WERE NEVER SPOKEN.</h2>
		<p>I am really proud of my brother. HATS OFF to HIM. IF I WAS IN HIS PLACE I dont think I would have sacrificed so much. In the past 16 yrs I have never spoken these words to you. Now also I can't tell you over the phone but writing this down so that you may see it and a small smile may pierce your cheeks by reading it and also sorry if I made you angry or embarrassed by sharing it on FACEBOOK, believe me I never had such intentions. You are really a genuine person and I am lucky to have you as my brother. I know that I am young and immature and I don&apos;t have any right to advice you but I can&apos;t stop myself from telling you that "DO WHAT you WANT, WE ARE ALL WITH you".. Love you ALWAYS!!!</p>

		<h2>First step!!</h2>
		<p>This is the first time I am starting to write in a blog. Everyone may think &quot;what is so great about it&quot;,but I want to tell you all that neither can I write nor speak English fluently, so if you find any mistake then let me know about it in your comments. I want to see whether my thoughts are good enough or whether  I have a bad idea about the things around us. I am very nervous and also excited. Let me see what happens, fingers crossed. I would look forward to your suggestions and also try to place my thoughts in front of you. I am feeling happy on seeing my blog being posted.</p>
